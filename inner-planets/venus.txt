Facts about Venus:

- Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, even hotter than Mercury, because its thick atmosphere traps heat.
_ Venus has a very slow rotation, so one day on Venus is longer than one year on the planet.
_ Venus spins in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east.
_ Venus is similar in size to Earth, which is why it is often called Earth’s twin.
- Venus has thick clouds made mostly of sulfuric acid.
