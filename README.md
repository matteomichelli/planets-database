Mercury, Venus, and Earth each have some cool and surprising fun facts. Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and has extreme temperature changes, going from scorching hot during the day to freezing cold at night because it has almost no atmosphere. Venus is often called Earth’s twin because it is similar in size, but it is actually the hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere that traps heat, and it spins so slowly that one day on Venus is longer than its year. Earth is the only known planet that supports life, thanks to its liquid water, protective atmosphere, and just the right distance from the Sun, and it is also the only planet not named after a Roman or Greek god.
