# Planets Database

This repository is a practice project for learning Git and GitHub workflows. It contains a simple directory structure with text files about inner planets and a CSV file storing basic planetary data such as distance from the Sun, diameter, and number of moons.

## Fun fact:

The Sun contains about 99.8% of the total mass of the entire solar system, meaning all the planets combined make up only a tiny fraction of it.

Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and has extreme temperature changes, going from scorching hot during the day to freezing cold at night because it has almost no atmosphere. Venus is often called Earth’s twin because it is similar in size, but it is actually the hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere that traps heat, and it spins so slowly that one day on Venus is longer than its year. Earth is the only known planet that supports life, thanks to its liquid water, protective atmosphere, and just the right distance from the Sun, and it is also the only planet not named after a Roman or Greek god.

# Planet Overview

Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, and Earth each represent very different types of planets in our solar system. Mercury and Venus are inner rocky planets close to the Sun, with Mercury having extreme temperature swings and Venus having a thick atmosphere that traps heat. Earth is also a rocky planet, but it is unique because it supports life due to liquid water and a balanced atmosphere. Jupiter and Saturn are massive gas giants located farther from the Sun, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, and they have many moons and ring systems, with Saturn’s rings being the most visible and well known.
